## Update Todo App

### Create a class Validator

**Add Validator**

● using **typescript** create a class **Validator** which has following
methods: createError and showError (for creating and
showing/hiding validation errors). The list of methods is not final - it
might be extended: feel free to add your own necessary methods
and fields.

**How it works**: when user clicks on the “Add” button, those
inputs/fields, which are not filled should be highlighted with red
border and and additional validation message should appear in the
bottom of the block (with the name of the field with an error)

● create a class Calendar and integrate your code from the previous
Homework for the Date field of th Todo app (optional: if it is
possible - try to use typescript (rewrite JS code) for that Calendar)

> **PS:** I really hope that I have completed **all** the requirements.
