### Advanced calendar

**Add additional functionality to your interactive calendar**
Refactor your calendar with writing code on functional or object oriented
paradigm
• When you click on a calendar date, in the cell should appear an input for
entering the text and a “save” button. When you click on this button, the
entered note appears in the calendar (there can be several notes for one
date). After adding a note to the calendar - there should be an ‘x’ button
next to each note - to remove the note from the calendar when it is clicked
• Add a possibility to store data from input in the localStorage of the browser
(read more about localStorage API)

> **PS:** I really hope that I have completed **all** the requirements.
