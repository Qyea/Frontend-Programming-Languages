# Home task 6

## Todo App

### Create an application consists of three parts (using typescript and webpack)

**Add tasks form**
Allows you to add tasks to the list. Task fields available for filling (only
the title is required):
● Heading

● Description

● Date

● Priority (dropdown list with more than one value) After adding a
task to the list, the form fields are reset (clean) to their initial value
(all except the date).

**Filter for task list**
The filter controls which tasks will be available in the list below. The filter
allows you to adjust the following settings
● whether to show completed tasks

● text search (case insensitive, search in both title and description)

● filter by date (minimum and maximum dates - both can be
specified, one can be any, none)

**Task list**
Displays the list of tasks in table form. The table header contains
controls that allow you to sort the table by column (in forward and
reverse order

> **PS:** I really hope that I have completed **all** the requirements.
