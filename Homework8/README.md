## Update Todo App

### Add decorators for methods createError and showError

- find and read by yourselves some additional information about

properties descriptors (David Flanagan, MDN)

- in your previously created class Validator (from the homework 7),

add decorators for methods createError and showError. A

decorator for the method createError should add additional

functionality: when an error was created we should be able to log

in the console, to save it in the localstorage and to send on the

server (you should not implement a function of sending data to the

server, you should just to handle the situation of possibility to send

data to the server with some mocked/example function):

> const fetchData = () => {}
> decor() {
> â€¦
> fetchData()
> }

- organize your code according to discussed in the video lection

approach

> **PS:** I really hope that I have completed **all** the requirements.
